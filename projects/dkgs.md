::: slot snippet
* Gameshow made for twitch livestream featuring full interface for hosts, players and video overlay
* Video overlay based on active OBS scene and segment of the show
* Died after google spreadsheets couldn't generate the json configurations used by the show anymore (could have optimised it by a lot)
